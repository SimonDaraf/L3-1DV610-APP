# BlackJack
The vision is to create a simple blackjack game that utilizes the simplified web components package for the UI.
The plan is to create a demo game (blackjack) and then allow further extensions with other simple card games.

## General Requirements

1. The game must feature a fully playable blackjack demo.
2. The backend must be designed in a way so that other games can derive from it without much editing.
3. The Demo UI does not need to be responsive and only needs to support a desktop environment.
4. The UI needs to be fully functional and readable.

## Dependencies

1. The game logic must be written in vanilla JavScript.
2. The UI must use the simplified-web-components package.
3. The code must be written in an object oriented way.
